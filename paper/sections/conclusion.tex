\section{Conclusion}

CORELS is an efficient and accurate algorithm for constructing provably
optimal rule lists.
Optimality is particularly important in the same domains where the
interpretability of the model has social consequences, e.g., recidivism
prediction.
While achieving optimality on such combinatoric optimization problems is
computationally hard, our ability to combine mathematically rigorous bounds
with aggressive data structure pruning makes realistically sized problems
tractable.
CORELS is amenable to parallelization, which should allow it to scale to
even larger problems.
