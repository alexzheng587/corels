We build a custom discrete optimization technique for building rule lists that
are certifiably optimal over a categorical feature space.
%
Through the use of careful bounds, data structures, and bit-vector operations,
we are able to achieve several orders of magnitude speedup in time,
and a massive reduction of memory requirements.
%
We can solve some practical problems to optimality in a matter of seconds.

This approach is a new alternative to CART and other decision tree methods.
